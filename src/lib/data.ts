// The old Article and Category types, and their data, are removed 
// as they were specific to BharatPulse and are not used in OPTOBHARAT's current structure.
// If new data structures are needed for OPTOBHARAT, they can be defined here or in src/types/index.ts.

// Example of how you might define new data structures if needed:
/*
export interface OptometryResource {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  url: string;
  type: 'article' | 'video' | 'tool';
}

export const resources: OptometryResource[] = [
  // ... your data
];
*/

// Placeholder for any OPTOBHARAT specific data or utility functions.
// For instance, if you have a list of governing body members, events, etc.
// you can define them here.

// Example:
/*
export interface Member {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
}

export const governingBodyMembers: Member[] = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Dr. Visionary', role: 'President' },
  // ... more members
];
*/
